# DSI_Team_Project-Bankruptcy_Prediction: :bar_chart:

This repository contains the implementation of a machine learning project to classify companies as "Bankrupt" or "Not Bankrupt" based on financial indicators. The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/company-bankruptcy-prediction).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of a company's bankruptcy using various financial ratios and indicators. The dataset spans data from 1999 to 2009 and includes 95 features, offering rich insights into financial health and corporate governance.
The data were collected from the Taiwan Economic Journal for the years 1999 to 2009. Company bankruptcy was defined based on the business regulations of the Taiwan Stock Exchange. The data was obtained from UCI Machine Learning Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Taiwanese+Bankruptcy+Prediction

## :moneybag: Business Case and Value

Corporate bankruptcy prediction is a critical aspect of financial risk management for businesses, investors, and financial institutions. This project aims to provide a robust and interpretable framework for identifying early warning signs of financial distress in companies, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions.



#### Business Case:

Early Risk Detection: Bankruptcy prediction models can help businesses identify potential financial risks early, allowing for timely interventions and strategic adjustments.
Investors and lenders can use such models to assess the creditworthiness of companies before extending loans or investing capital.

Efficient Resource Allocation: Financial institutions can prioritize resources for companies showing signs of distress and develop customized support strategies to mitigate potential losses.

Regulatory Compliance: Governments and regulators can leverage bankruptcy prediction models to monitor and enforce corporate governance standards, reducing systemic risks in the economy.

Improved Decision-Making: Companies can use the insights from this model to make data-driven decisions for improving financial health and mitigating operational inefficiencies.

#### Value Delivered:

Stakeholder Protection: Protects investors and creditors from unexpected financial losses by providing a reliable bankruptcy risk assessment tool.

Economic Stability: Early identification of financially distressed firms reduces the risk of large-scale corporate failures, contributing to overall economic stability.

Cost Reduction: Automating the bankruptcy prediction process minimizes reliance on extensive manual evaluations, reducing operational costs.

Strategic Planning: Businesses can use the modelâ€™s outputs to align their long-term strategies with financial sustainability, ensuring robust growth and avoiding unnecessary risks.

Customizable and Scalable: This model can be adapted for different industries, geographies, and economic conditions, making it a versatile tool for stakeholders.
By implementing this project, organizations and financial professionals can achieve a higher degree of foresight into potential bankruptcies, saving time, resources, and mitigating risks in their operations.
