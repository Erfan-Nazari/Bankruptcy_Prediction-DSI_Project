## Business Case and Value
### Our project focuses on three key business questions related to car sales:

#### Predicting Car Body Style Preference:

Question: Can we predict which category of car (e.g., SUV vs. Sedan) a customer is likely to purchase based on demographic factors and historical purchase data?

Business Value: By understanding which demographic factors influence the purchase of different car categories, businesses can better tailor their marketing efforts and inventory planning. For instance, if certain regions or income levels are more likely to buy SUVs, dealerships can optimize their stock and promotions to meet this demand, leading to increased sales and customer satisfaction.

#### Predicting Best-Selling Car Models:

Question: Can we predict whether a particular car model will be a "best-seller" (yes/no) based on features, historical sales data, and marketing efforts?

Business Value: Identifying the features and conditions that make a car model a best-seller allows businesses to improve marketing strategies, adjust pricing models, and focus resources on cars that are more likely to perform well in the market. This reduces wasted marketing budgets and improves profitability.
Price Estimation for Cars:

Question: Can we estimate the selling price of a car based on its features, brand reputation, and market conditions?

Business Value: A reliable price estimation model helps dealerships to set competitive yet profitable prices based on market trends and car features. This ensures that they are neither underpricing their cars, which can lead to lost revenue, nor overpricing them, which can drive away potential customers.
